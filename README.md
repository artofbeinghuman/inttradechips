# Project Notes: Chip shortage impact on European car exports

## Compare Electronics vs Macinery, in Trade between Germany and Taiwan

Should we focus on only the chips that are used in cars (higher nm architectures) or should we take all chips (also including cutting edge)?
Which Asian countries should we aggregate? Taiwan, China, South Korea, (Japan)?
Which European ones? EU27 + UK?
Would this be valid variables for this analysis?

Possible Inputs: Capital + Skilled Labor/Technology
Outputs: Cars or Chips
Assumption: Everyone working at chips fab is skilled labour by definition.

What should the result/conclusion include? "Trade is good", "EU Policy of increasing European chip fabrication is sensible", etc:

Talk about comparative advantages.

Why where chips produced in Asia?
Labor endowment in Asia? Relative wages

in specific labour model we look at relative labor.

doesnt have to be quantiative, we could also just show dynamics in PPF graphs etc.
how has chips vs car trade developed in the last ten years

Maybe **Taiwan vs Germany** makes it clearer!
One country mighjt have absolut adavantage in all goods, the question is which country has **relative advantage**.

Draw PPF, draw production vs consumption
produce a lot of cars, but don't consume them all.
pick dynamics, e.g. COvid, or last ten years.
Show the changes in relative demand/supply, advantage. Show how trade changed
Is it "standard trade", is it HO?

Are we explaining what happened, or are we predicting how it will develop in the future.
Explain why you see the trade, why do we see specialisation.

If we want to be more quantiative, we could use a Cobb Douglas function.

What caused the change, how has this changed the country's situation, how has world equlibium changed.

"What has determined the car and chip trade in the last decade."
